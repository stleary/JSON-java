# Overview

[JSON](http://www.JSON.org/) is a light-weight language-independent data interchange format.

The JSON-Java package is a reference implementation that demonstrates how to parse JSON documents into Java objects and how to generate new JSON documents from the Java classes.

Project goals include:
* Reliable and consistent results
* Adherence to the JSON specification 
* Easy to build, use, and include in other projects
* No external dependencies
* Fast execution and low memory footprint
* Maintain backward compatibility
* Designed and tested to use on Java versions 1.6 - 21


The files in this package implement JSON encoders and decoders. The package can also convert between JSON and XML, HTTP headers, Cookies, and CDL.

For more information on contributions, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Bug fixes, code improvements, and unit test coverage changes are welcome! Because this project is currently in the maintenance phase, the kinds of changes that can be accepted are limited. For more information, please read the [FAQ](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java/wiki/FAQ).

# Build Instructions

The org.json package can be built from the command line, Maven, and Gradle. The unit tests can be executed from Maven, Gradle, or individually in an IDE e.g. Eclipse.

**Building from the command line**

*Build the class files from the package root directory src/main/java*
```shell
javac org/json/*.java
```

*Create the jar file in the current directory*
```shell
jar cf json-java.jar org/json/*.class
```

*Compile a program that uses the jar (see example code below)*
```shell
javac -cp .;json-java.jar Test.java (Windows)
javac -cp .:json-java.jar Test.java (Unix Systems)
```

*Test file contents*

```java
import org.json.JSONObject;
public class Test {
    public static void main(String args[]){
       JSONObject jo = new JSONObject("{ \"abc\" : \"def\" }");
       System.out.println(jo);
    }
}
```

*Execute the Test file*
```shell 
java -cp .;json-java.jar Test (Windows)
java -cp .:json-java.jar Test (Unix Systems)
```

*Expected output*

```json
{"abc":"def"}
```


**Tools to build the package and execute the unit tests**

Execute the test suite with Maven:
```shell
mvn clean test
```

Execute the test suite with Gradlew:

```shell
gradlew clean build test
```

*Optional* Execute the test suite in strict mode with Gradlew:

```shell
gradlew testWithStrictMode
```

*Optional* Execute the test suite in strict mode with Maven:

```shell
mvn test -P test-strict-mode 
```

# Milestone 2

For the Milestone 2 of SWE262P, 2 new functions were added:

```java
static JSONObject toJSONObject(Reader reader, JSONPointer path) 
static JSONObject toJSONObject(Reader reader, JSONPointer path, JSONObject replacement) 
```

The first one takes in 2 parameters, a `Reader` object which contains some XML input and a `JSONPointer` object that includes a json path for querying, and returns a `JSONObject` object which has the corresponding path, or throw an error if that path does not exist.

The first one takes in 3 parameters, a `Reader` object which contains some XML input and a `JSONPointer` object that includes a json path for querying, and a `JSONObject` for replacement. And returns a new `JSONObject` object which has the corresponding path replaced with the new given object, or throw an error if that path does not exist.

Both new functions are placed in the `XML.java` file.

The test cases of the functions are placed under the `org.json.junit.milestone2.tests` package, and to run the test case which deals with large file input, first create a folder named `xml_files` under the `/src/test/resources` path, and put the xml files for testing under this path.
